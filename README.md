## Git Commits
These are the keywords I will use when commiting changes (based on conventional commits):

fix: must be used when the commit represents the fix of an error of the code
feat: must be used when the commit represents a new feature added to the application
docs: must be used when the commit represents a change in the documentation of the application
refactor: must be used when the commit represents an improvement in the code of the application
style: must be used when the commit represents a change in the design of the website or a change that does not affect the code like deleting white spaces, formatting, adding dots, etc.
